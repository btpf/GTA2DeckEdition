Thank you for taking the time to download the non-total conversion of GTA2 "Criminal Petersburg"! This is still a small game about the hard everyday life of a Russian bandit in the criminal capital of Russia. GTA2000, total conversion of GTA2, pushed me to the idea of ​​creating GTA2 on "our" theme. This project, unfortunately, is very long-term, but the creation of small stages (such as PP) is a quick and easy thing.

GTA 2 : Crime Petersburg


Thank you for taking the time to download the non-total conversion of GTA2 "Criminal Petersburg"! This is still a small game about the hard everyday life of a Russian bandit in the criminal capital of Russia. GTA2000, total conversion of GTA2, pushed me to the idea of ​​creating GTA2 on "our" theme. This project, unfortunately, is very long-term, but the creation of small stages (such as PP) is a quick and easy thing.

When creating I used:

GTA2 Map Editor version 9.0.0.0 by DMA Design - for creating maps

GTA2 Script Compiler version 9.6 by DMA Design - for compiling scripts

GXTed and GCTTXT - for creating texts

"Stirlitz" - for encoding texts under the language of GTA2

GENERAL QUESTIONS:

First, why Petersburg? There are plenty of other cities with a much worse reputation, why not take some lesser known one?

Everything is very simple. I needed some kind of Russian city - once, and a city with a good river system - two. Peter fits both. Nothing complicated.

What explains this choice of criminal gangs?

All three mafias represented in the PP are the most painful topic in Russia. If any of you don't like the new Russians - for God's sake, take a car and wind the strong-headed ones on wheels. Tired of "persons of Caucasian nationality"? We are looking for an electric shock and arrange a session of shock therapy for the chocks ... everything is simple!

INSTALLATION :

First you need to backup some files -

test1.seq - information about executable files

r.gxt - Russian text file for GTA

plyslot0.dat - data about the first player

plyslot0.svg - "savegame" file for the first player.

It is enough to copy them to some directory, and if you ever decide to return to the original version of GTA2 , restore them.

Now you need to copy the files and directories from the archive with the software to the DATA directory where the game is installed. This:

StPet1.scr - PP script file

StPet1.gmp - pet map file

r.gxt - file with texts for PP

StPet1/StPet1.scr, Stpet2.scr, SrPet3.scr - PP mission files

FOR LAUNCH:

Launch GTA2 and start a new game on the first level.

DATA :

How many missions, mafias, bonuses, what type of city, etc...

I chose the design of the first area of ​​the original GTA2 . There are three radio stations, not counting the "neutral". There are seven secrets, one is KILL FRENZY on a tank, two are secret vehicles with unique abilities, one is a powerful weapon , and three are power-ups. Some are easy to see, but hard to take. Others are easy to reach but cannot be seen.

So far, there are only three missions, but perhaps more will appear soon. The maximum level of the police is the fourth (OMON detachments). Each gang has a unique weapon, and the last options are very, very powerful (electric shocks and bazookas).

Most likely, not only new missions will be created, but also a new town of approximately the same size. This town will be a direct continuation of the first. It is possible to create a bonus level.

To finish the level, you need to collect 500,000$, take a tank and go back to the place where you started from. You will be able to learn how to infiltrate the tank if you complete all three missions. You are guaranteed to be able to collect the required amount if you complete the tasks in the order green-yellow-red.

How are mafia men dressed? How is this explained?

New Russians - in white. Of course, it would be more correct to dress them in red, but in this way you can confuse them with another mafia ... The "face" of the new Russians is the mug of the Yakuza. Arrogant and important, just the way it should be. The symbol of the new Russians is the sign of the Yakuza.

OMON , of course, in green. It was very difficult to choose the "face" of the OMON, and I settled on the face of Zaibatsu. Imagine that this is some retired general. The OMON symbol is a red star.

Chechens asked for black clothes. The representative of Chechnya is a "Russian" mug, which is more like a person of Caucasian nationality. The symbol of the Chechens, as a symbol of organized crime, is the Zaibatsu sign.

GAME QUESTIONS:

Why are so few weapons issued? Only one machine! Is this a glitch?

No, this is not a glitch. I believe that a real bandit (and even more so Russian) should get his weapons from the bodies of other bandits. There are several places in the game where gang lines converge. It is enough to go there and hang around for about five minutes, as you pick up a whole bunch of trophies. Or you can take "only one machine gun" and kill a few gangsters. They will not be offended, but you will pick up a lot of guns.

I can't complete the mission! They keep killing me!

Remember that at least me and two of my tester friends completed this mission before you. A few top tips - don't piss off the police (they are very pushy) and do what you're told. If they say to destroy the car - destroy the car, do not mess with the guards if they are strong enough! A simple example - in one task it is enough to accelerate well and push an enemy truck into the water, and quickly turn into an alley from the guards.

How to get to the tank?

The fact is that you can get to it at any time in the game. But HOW to get there - you will find out only after you complete all the missions!

What kind of nasty bastard with an electric gun?

And this is so that life does not seem like honey. If you don't kill him in time, he may appear at the most inopportune moment and end your existence.

I'm a stupid and nasty cheater, now I will turn on the codes and fuck your level in all holes!

Ahh, I have a surprise for the cheaters! The electric guns that some mafia are armed with can easily kill even an invulnerable player. Rocket launchers of other mafiosi destroy most cars with one shot, and this is certain death for an "invulnerable" driver. In general, if you are a cheater, then erase the PP as soon as possible and do not even launch it. I didn't try for those...

GLU KI:

There are big traffic jams in the city!

In the original GTA2, the size of the city was colossal and you rarely stopped in one place while racing through it. Cars don't stay in the cache for that long, and any resulting traffic jams are unloaded. Here, if a traffic jam appears, it will remain for a very long time, because you are unlikely to run to the other end of the city to get rid of it by unloading it from memory.

The game sometimes crashes!

I can't help it. During testing, situations were created when the GTA engine could not process them and the game crashed. Do everything right and everything will be fine. In the mission for the new Russians, the fleeing Chechen must be shot down wherever you see the gate. Otherwise the game will crash. In the mission for the OMON, you first need to open the gate, and then kill the leader, but not vice versa.

I found an obvious glitch! (Player falls to the floor, etc.)

You are very attentive! Please tell about it in writing to my postal address.

THANK YOU:
