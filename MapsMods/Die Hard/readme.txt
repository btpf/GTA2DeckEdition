DIE HARD Vol.1 - README
Installation:
It is highly recommended to backup some files, which need to be replaced in order to play this map. These files should be copied in a backup directory:
test1.seq
e.gxt
Now copy the test1.seq, dh.scr, dh.gmp from the zip-file into your gta2/data directory and overwrite the old ones. You can now play the map by starting GTa2 and selecting the 1.Level.

General Information:
Game Type: GTa2 Singleplayer
Author: chriZ (chriz@cmga.net)
Homepage: www.gtazone.de
Mapstyle: Stunt map with small missions
Used programs: GTa2 Mapeditor, GTa2 Script Compiler, GXTed

Addition:
It took me some time to place the lights and it would be a pity if you play the map with the video option "noon". Please change this option to "dusk" (with the GTa2 Manager in your gta2 folder) and enjoy the map with a lot more atmosphere. You won´t regret it.

Hints:
- Always try to stay in the middle of the road
- You can take some jumps only with full-speed, so don´t use the break or drive at obstacles
- Answer the phones, they give you useful information
- Sometimes you can make the mini missions a lot easier if you kill the enemies before driving on
- Know the map. Once you played it a few times, you´ll learn how to kill the enemies very easily
- Don´t drive too fast or you´ll get drowned very often
