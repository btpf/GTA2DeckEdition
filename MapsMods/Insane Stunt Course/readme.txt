Insane Stunt Cours - made by Holy_Jack and OXMOX, MOONMONKEYS 
*********************

For everybody who enjoy to jump and drive slamlom.
Your mission is to bring Elvis (you) to a friend´s party. Good luck!
We know that it´s hard to play, but when you try it often you´ll make it.
The map includes Lights (more ambience), but they are not so good.
This is our first map, we hope that there are no bugs 
but if you find one, please mail us: moonmonkeys@gmx.net
Sorry for our bad school-english (we´re from germany) :(
You can correct our mistakes and send us.

Installation:
Extract the ISC.scr and the ISC.gmp to the \data directory of GTA2
backup the original .seq file and the e.gxt, extract the two that are 
in the zip to there too.

And than have fun!


The Insane Stunt Cours replace the first Level and use the ste.sty
