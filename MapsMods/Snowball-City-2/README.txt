whats new in this version?  ummm, made a bunch of new cars, added
gangs, gang logos, more missions, area names, busstops, some new 
tiles, and more.
this might end up being the final version, as theres not much left
to do anyways.  sure theres a few of the origianl cars still, but
im sick of messing with those ugly ingame palletes.  besides, it
gives you some spots to install cars of your choice.  i may write
a mission add-on one day to finish the storyline, but i cant 
promise anything:)

first off, big ups to Schu for helping me to get the map editor 
working! 
i also want to say thanks to Azz, Alfadog, GTAKreyz, Paul, Camdog,
and the car preview forum for prodding and/or inspiring me in the 
right direction (hopefully) of car making.
