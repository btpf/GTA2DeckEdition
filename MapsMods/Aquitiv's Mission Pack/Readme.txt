Aqutiv's Mission Pack
---------------------

Thanx for trying this mission pack.
This mission pack is for GTA2, and
replaces the two Zaibatsu mission
on the Industrial District (The third area of GTA2)
I'm not responsible for anything caused to you or your
GTA2 software by this pack. so follow the instructions! 
Note that the missions may have some bad language, but don't complain
because GTA2 is intended anyway, for mature people only.
one of the mission is really hard, I myself almost couldn't pass
it, the other one is a lot easier but more complex and has
a better background. As evrything else, GTA2 missions DO have
bugs. so if you notice any. please report me! 
(Tough I don't think I will rerelease those missions, but it will
help me to make better missions in the future)
The only obvious bug I know is the Z! before all briefs,
I myself don't know much about GXT Editing, so I used
GXTed which does this problem. it will be nice if someone could
make a GXT editor that do not do this problem.
send any suggestion (for new missions, parhaps),
Comments, Bug Reports to my e-mail below.


Instructions:
1. BACK UP your files. (simply copy them to another
folder or disk) that way you can recover the original
missions, and the 'working fine' GXT file.
also if anything goes wrong, recover your old files with the back-up
you made.

2. Copy the E.GXT to the \Data directory of GTA2,
and both .mis files to the \Data\Bil Directory of GTA2.
3. Run the game, start playing at the third level.
both missions can be found at the Zaibatsu green phones. 
(use the gray-green arrow to get to these phones)
Enjoy!
