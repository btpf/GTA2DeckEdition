Escape


What's New   Added one mission and a reward for completing all of them. Finally added the jailbreak at the start of the game that was originally planned and that the level was named for.

Past Features   Large map with working train system and missions based on killing N'Sync.

Installation   Create a new folder in your /data directory and copy the e.gxt and test1.seq files into it. Unzip escape.zip into the /data folder, overwriting any files when prompted. Start GTA2 and select level 1 to play. To restore the original level delete escape.mis , escape.gmp , and escape.scr . Then put the files you backed up earlier back into the /data folder, overwriting when prompted.
