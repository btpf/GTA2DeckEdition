<b>What's New &nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Added one mission and a reward for completing all of them. Finally added the jailbreak at the start of the game that was originally planned and that the level was named for.<br><br>

<b>Past Features &nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Large map with working train system and missions based on killing N'Sync.<br><br>

<b>Installation &nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Create a new folder in your /data directory and copy the e.gxt and test1.seq files into it. Unzip escape.zip into the /data folder, overwriting any files when prompted. Start GTA2 and select level 1 to play. To restore the original level delete escape.mis , escape.gmp , and escape.scr . Then put the files you backed up earlier
back into the /data folder, overwriting when prompted.<br><br>
