   Please feel free to send me feedback and constructive critsism and if you happen to be a script wizard maybe you can help me to add some missions although i cant think of what the hell they will be about. I have made many maps but this is the only one that ever worked which is why this map may not seem as if a novice made it. Once It is completely doe with there will be many powerups but they will be so hidden I doubt you will ever find them all! There is much more to this map that I can tell you about but I dont wanna spoil it! Enjoy it !
