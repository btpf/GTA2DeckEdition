1. MAP-HISTORY
Chapter 1: How it started

A long, long time ago in the summer holidays a 2-man team started to create the perfect map for GTA2, orientating on the original maps. Thereby they had to pass many hinderances, like numerously system crashes due to the crappy Edit>Objects>Edit command and stuff like that. But one day the time has come: The first Version (1.0) was born.

Chapter 2: The first functioning map

There were still some leaks and the cars got on each other when crossing the junctions, but all that wasn't really mentionable. Weapons also weren't included and the map crashed with and without trains. This didn't encourage us and so we continued going our way.

Chapter 3: The trains and other little problems

The consequences of these goals were a 5-7 day long work on the map to get the stupid trains to work. After this week I stopped work on the trains but I left the trackage because you never know what might happen. The creation of working junctions was the next milestone we reached even at the first attempt. Another problem were the roads because after the junctions were finished I realized that the cars don't have an idea of driving and that 98% percent of the people were driving on the wrong side of the street.

Chapter 4: GTA-Edit Last Help

With the current situation (and with the trains still not working after 34 tries) I contacted Kain of GTA-2.de who told me to visit Gtaedit.gtazone.de what I immediatly did. He also explained me how to use the arrows which was another advancement. Luckily also the trains worked then but regretfully just to a certain point, then it crashed again. The goal to get the trains working was dead again. Besides that there was another thing that shocked me: I was able to place arrows but they weren't displayed because I accidently deleted the Editor's "Data" folder, which contained the file arrows.raw. After a re-install even this problem was solved and the 2nd version (1.1) was finished.

Chapter 5: Build, build, build

After I finally succeded in telling the cars how to drive I continued to construct buildings. During this time my parents, luckily, left the house for the whole weekend so I had enough time to work on the map. On the days Saturday and Sunday my PC was running a little marathon from 10 am to 1 am. (15 hrs.) After this my eyes were shaped like a rectangle so one could easily confuse myself with the TV. But it was worth everything because in this time the best buildings were created and I was able to finish the map one week later (also because I complete went through GTA-Edit).

Chapter 6: Scripting - Endless boredom

Because the map was finally finished I got myself the Script-Editor, which also needed a lot of my patience. You must for example not hit the "Enter" key or the whole Script-Editor would crash and my script would be send into nirvana. (It happened often). Besides that some commands were false and had to be corrected manually. Another thing was the compiler. He was that picky and revolted because of every single bracket, every space and every single command that was wrong. And you even didn't get what it wants because his messages didn't say you anything.

I set and activated 100 Weapongenerators, wrote special effects for the start, set 30 soundeffects, a save-point, about 100 cars, did 2 cranes, 3 shop halls, Gang-Info, 3 Gang-Info-Phones and other little things. Luckily I still had my old PC who was connected to my newer one so I did the scripting on one computer and my pal changed the map on the other one. My little brother, who did nothing except some "Beta-Testing" gave me the coordinates for the weapons etc.

Chapter 7: Train problems solved

Short after that and thanks to my neverending strive to get the trains working sometime I succeded at last in creating the first working rail. Due to a simple, not even mentioned problems (which I think is unknown by many Map-Creators; who really wants to know what it is: Mail to webmaster@Compu-Terra.de) the trains refused to work. Changed the script and it was done. With time I added more Stations, today there are 8 of them, allocated on 3 rails with 2 trains each. The 3rd version (1.2) was finished.

Chapter 8: Some details

After doing this we went on to the finer details like powerlines and some weapons. The rails were rerouted a little bit and some graphic related errors were corrected. THE MAP WAS FINISHED (final Version 2.0)



To write missions was to much stress to me and so it is a fact, that there are no missions at all, what I really regret. But what can one do...

Chapter 9: The Map-Contest

One day I received E-mail from Gleb who wanted to present the map in the PC-Action magazine. I for sure got on it and because he even reminded me of the map-contest I started to overdo the map. That also contained to write the hated missions. I realized that there is too much to do and so I am still working on a map which is worth the PC-Action today.

2. STORY
We find ourself in early 21st century, in a small city called "Gangsta-City", a blooming metropole in the south of the USA. For this reason it was also selected for the EXPO 2010 which is hold at the moment.

But the map also has its seamy sides - years ago the Zaibatsus arrived, a worldwide operating clan of criminals, who controlled more than the half of the city. Other gangs followed, who harmed the monopole-gang, and so the city is now divided into 5 parts. The North-West is still under the Zaibatsu's control, with the Loonies in the south, a horde of crazy people who fled out of a lynatic asylum, the Yakuza in the North-East. A little part of the town is under control of the PC-Action Gang, who one could easily compare to the Loonies. Insanes, who don't want to explore the sense of life rather than fighting through the neverending depths of PC-Games, always searching for the next Gaming-Hits.

Now there is one Question: How is it possible to arrange th EXPO in such a town? Quite simple. The Zaibatsu want to use the EXPO as a distraction of the other gangs to get their business running again. Because of that they paid money to the mayor and a faked opinion about the city was on the way to the commission of the EXPO. That's how the EXPO came to "Gangsta-City".

At this very point it is your turn. You are a little criminal who seeked for a master in a lot of American cities and you feel that this is now the right one.

Now decide for yourself if you want to support the Zaibatsus, or if you help the Loonies in their quest of finding the sens of Life or if you help the Yakuza buying new clothes or if you help the PC-Action Gang in completing the newest Beta-Versions of the newest games... It is all your decision who has the power in the future of "Gangsta-City"!

the complete folder "frontend"
After you created the backup copies you open the Setup.zip with Winzip, then click on the button "Extract". A new window should open. Now type in the path of your "Data" folder of GTA2. For example: "C:\Program files\GTA2\data". Click on "Extract" which is located on the top right of the window. The installation starts now. When WinZip asks if you want to overwrite some files, you have to click on "yes", otherwise the new map will not be playable.

"Gangsta-City" is then playable directly by selecting the first map. The multiplayer version of this map can be selected as usual in the Network window. You shouldn't change the settings otherwise the gameing quality may not be reached.

If you still want to do so, then I just can recommend to take a look in the Gamezforum, especially in the GTA-Zone, or to visit these Links. Without help you will not get very far...
